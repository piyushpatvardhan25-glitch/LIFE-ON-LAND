    <h2>Tree Planation Program</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>  Our Tree Plantation Monitoring System is designed to accurately track and manage the number of trees planted under this specific plantation program. 
            The system provides a centralized and reliable platform where all planting activities can be recorded, verified, and monitored in real time.
            By maintaining detailed data on each planted tree, the system helps ensure transparency, improve reporting, and support long-term environmental planning. 
            This tool not only makes tracking easier for organizers and field teams but also strengthens accountability, promotes sustainability, and contributes
            to the overall success of the tree-plantation initiative.
